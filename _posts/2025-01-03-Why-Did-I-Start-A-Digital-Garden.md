I figured for my first post I'd start with, why... Why did I start a digital garden?

A few reasons.

One day while I was on Twitter I came across a thread that started with this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you&#39;re in IT, I highly encourage you to write a blog. <br><br>Here are 17 reasons why you should be blogging.<br>üßµüëá</p>&mdash; Jack Rhysider üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (@JackRhysider) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416387434762241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I won't list all 17 reasons why but I'll list a few that stood out to me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. Don&#39;t think of the blog as some new profound insight that makes you look smart. Instead, just write notes to yourself. If you make the blog useful to you, it&#39;ll be useful to others.</p>&mdash; Jack Rhysider üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (@JackRhysider) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416388785344512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">7. The most underrated skill to have in IT is ability to communicate effectively. Blogging is leveling that skill up. Are people getting what they need efficiently and effectively when they land on your site? Can you explain the concepts even better? Rewrite it, level up.</p>&mdash; Jack Rhysider üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (@JackRhysider) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416395517194241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you wanted to have a read through the thread in it's entirety, you can find it [here](https://twitter.com/JackRhysider/status/1524416387434762241?s=20&t=RDwQ2C8mTDJ98h8WtbOs8g)

I felt as though this thread I'd stumbled upon left an impression on me, combined with this [blog post](https://ronamosa.io/docs/engineer/AWS/2018-07-29-Building-my-AWS-s3-jekyll-blog) that I'd read a few years ago - this was all the conviction I needed to want to start a digital garden.

Basically, I started this digital garden to document my learnings, level up my communication/writing skills, have an online notebook for self reference and possibly help others who may find themselves struggling with something I once worked through.
